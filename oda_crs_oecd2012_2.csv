CIDA's contribution directly supports the implementation of the Government of Ghana's Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II).   As with all budget support initiatives, Canada is working in close cooperation with other donors and the Government of Ghana to strengthen aid effectiveness, by focussing on effective, transparent, and accountable country systems; increasing donor coordination and harmonization; and strengthening mutual accountability. Budgetary support also fosters greater policy dialogue among CIDA, government, and partners, thus helping to strengthen efforts for effective, focussed aid, as well as long-term development results. This initiative is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors. / Ce projet constitue le deuxième volet du Programme de soutien à la Stratégie de croissance et de réduction de la pauvreté du Ghana. Grâce à ce volet, l'ACDI fournit un soutien budgétaire sectoriel au gouvernement du Ghana pour accroître ses efforts de promotion d'un développement durable en milieu rural grâce à l'alimentation et à l'agriculture. La contribution de l'ACDI appuie directement la mise en oeuvre de la Politique de développement du secteur de l'alimentation et de l'agriculture du gouvernement du Ghana (phase II).   Comme dans toutes ses initiatives de soutien budgétaire, le Canada travaille en étroite collaboration avec d'autres donateurs et le gouvernement du Ghana afin de renforcer l'efficacité de l'aide, et ce, en ciblant des systèmes nationaux efficaces, transparents et responsables; et en accroissant la coordination et l'harmonisation entre les donateurs; en renforçant la responsabilité partagée. Le soutien budgétaire favorise également un meilleur dialogue sur les politiques entre l'ACDI, le gouvernement et les partenaires, ce qui contribue à consolider les efforts visant une aide efficace et ciblée, ainsi que des résultats de développement à long terme. Cette initiative est surveillée continuellement et évaluée de concert avec les autres donateurs.",NA,1,2,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31192,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The idea is to encourage and train the local communities to take charge of their own development. The programme that was started in 1998 is now moving towards more concentration on the growing urban centre, Savannakhet. The programme was recently evaluated by the Laosian authorities as one of the best CEP programmes in the country. Fida cooperates with several local authorities and goverment offices. Through the programme the village communities have received capacity-building on preventive health care, agriculture and micro-enterprise formation. Now, as the focus is moving more towards the urban poor, there will be more concentration on micro-enterprise activities.

Combined rainfed maize-legume cropping systems show considerable promise in boosting productivity and helping reverse the decline in soil fertility that is a fundamental cause of low smallholder productivity in the region.

In 2005 and 2010, these two factors led to food scarcity in Niger. However, innovative technologies such as microdose fertilization combined with rainwater catchment could improve soil fertility and moisture, thereby increasing crop yields.Microdosage is the addition of small amounts of fertilizer to plants at the time of seeding or after germination. Even though this technology can increase yields by up to 120%, only 5% of producers in the Sahel use it. This low rate of adoption is due to inability to buy inputs, weak policy support and insufficient investment in agricultural services, including extension.This project - supported by the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF), a joint program of IDRC and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) - will identify the appropriate means of microcredit for promoting microdosage, examine the social and political factors that influence food security, and evaluate the long-term effects of microdosage and rainwater collection on the dynamics of nutrient cycling and groundwater in monoculture and intercropped systems in the Sahel.",NA,0,1,0,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31161,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although children and youth represent between 43% and 49% of the population in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, their rights are not well protected by the justice systems in their country. Children and youth face challenges such as discrimination against girls, child labour, domestic violence, sexual assault, and child trafficking.   The project includes creating national working groups and establishing legal aid and pro bono services for children and youth. It includes delivering public education programs to raise awareness about children's rights and issues that affect children and youth, as well as about the legal services available to help children and youth. The project also provides training on children's rights for judges, lawyers, court workers, and government officials and professional training for lawyers and paralegals to equip them to handle juvenile cases. / Le but du projet est d'améliorer les services légaux au profit des enfants et des jeunes en Afrique de l'Est afin qu'ils puissent accéder à la protection légale au besoin.

Les enfants et les jeunes font face à des défis tels que la discrimination contre les filles, le travail des enfants, la violence conjugale, les agressions sexuelles et la traite des enfants.   Le projet comprend la création de groupes de travail nationaux et l'établissement de l'aide juridique et autres services légaux gratuits pour les enfants et les jeunes. Ceci comprend la conduite de programmes d'éducation publique de sensibilisation aux droits des enfants et des problèmes qui touchent les enfants et les jeunes, ainsi que des programmes de renseignements sur les services juridiques qui sont disponibles pour aider les enfants et les jeunes. Le projet comprend également la conduite de formation sur les droits des enfants pour les juges, les avocats et les travailleurs des tribunaux, et des représentants du gouvernement, et de la formation professionnelle pour les avocats et les para juristes afin de mieux les outiller pour s'occuper des cas juridiques qui impliquent des mineurs.",NA,1,0,2,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,"2012-10-25",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15130,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

CIDA will continue to assess the situation and make further decisions as events evolve.   ___     This project forms the cornerstone of Canada's support for the achievement of development objectives in health, education, and public financial management in Mali. The main focus of this contribution is to help the Government of Mali implement its sector policies, as defined in Mali's Strategic Framework for Growth and Poverty Reduction, 2007-2011.   As with all budget support projects, Canada is working in close cooperation with other donors and the Government of Mali to strengthen the effectiveness of its aid by: focussing on effective, transparent, and accountable country systems; increasing donor coordination and harmonization; and strengthening mutual accountability. Sector-wide budgetary support also fosters greater policy dialogue between CIDA, the Government of Mali, and development partners, thus reinforcing efforts for effective, focussed aid, as well as long-term development results. This project is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors.   This initiative aims to strengthen Mali's national education and health programs and to modernize public financial management, through direct support to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance. The desired impact of the initiative is to make quality education more available to girls and boys, and quality health care more available to the general public. It also aims to achieve progress in the transparency and rigour of public financial management and in the governance of Mali's health and education systems. All of this helps to strengthen overall capacity in Mali and to sustain results achieved long after the project is completed. / Le 24 mars 2012, le Canada a suspendu son aide comportant le versement direct de fonds au gouvernement du Mali, mais a maintenu ses projets mis en oeuvre par des partenaires multilatéraux et mondiaux et par des organisations non gouvernementales canadiennes et locales, là oÃ¹ la sécurité le permet.

A free, well functioning and independent media sector is widely recognised as being critical to promoting better governance which in turn can improve the quality of development outcomes. PACMAS will adopt a Communication for Development (C4D) approach and support broader engagement with the media and communications sectors in the Pacific to encourage effective policy environments and a plurality of media voices. PACMAS will deliver: media capacity building for journalists, senior editors and media leaders, broadcast engineers and information communication technicians; media policy and legislation advocacy to support media legislation and reforms that promote: (i) freedom of speech, information and expression; (ii) the development of community media; (iii) the independence of regulatory bodies; and (iv) the role that new information and communication technologies can play in national development and regional integration; Media Systems technical capacity building aims to ensure that public access to media is maintained and extended; and production will be encouraged that is both innovative (across multiple media platforms); which addresses issues associated with poverty reduction and better governance; and gives voice (through increased access to media production) to marginalised and disadvantaged groups.

Its principal objectives are to: a) promote private sector growth and create conditions for an effective supply response from viable private enterprises and farmers; b) facilitate the banking sector transformation and integration into international financial markets; and c) stimulate credit market competition. At the level of individual banks, the project aims to provide hands-on-assistance for institutional strengthening and the adoption of safe and sound banking practices. The project will contribute to reversing the country's economy decline and to increase the private sector share in the economy.

The program delivers services in community preventive health, HIV/AIDS education and homecare for the chronically ill. The other local partner, CAIXA das Mulheres, provides a safe place for women to deposit their money and obtain credit to run their small businesses. Branches are located in Nampula, Nacala and Pemba.   In conjunction with its partners, Cooperation Canada Mozambique (COCAMO) has developed a flexible and comprehensive capacity development program that is custom-designed to address the current and future organizational needs of its partners to become increasingly autonomous, effective, gender-sensitive and responsive to the program's beneficiaries. / Le programme vise à rehausser la capacité des organisations non gouvernementales locales qui travaillent dans les secteurs de l'amélioration des résultats de santé et du développement de possibilités économiques par l'entremise de coopératives de microcrédit pour les femmes. Des programmes axés sur l'égalité des sexes sont intégrés dans toutes les activités. Des pratiques de bonne gouvernance incluent de la formation en comptabilité transparente. Un des partenaires locaux, SALAMA, se concentre sur la programmation de santé préventive communautaire dans les villages isolés. Le programme fournit des services de santé préventive communautaire, d'éducation sur le VIH/sida et des soins à domicile pour les malades chroniques. L'autre partenaire local, CAIXA das Mulheres, fournit un environnement sécuritaire afin que les femmes puissent déposer leur argent et obtenir du crédit pour opérer leurs petites entreprises. Des succursales sont situées à Nampula, Nacala et Pemba.   En collaboration avec ses partenaires, la Coopération Canada Mozambique (COCAMO) a développé un programme de développement des capacités flexible, complet et fait sur mesure pour répondre aux besoins actuels et futures des organisations partenaires afin qu'elles puissent devenir de plus en plus autonomes, efficaces, sensibilisées à l'égalité des sexes et réactives envers les bénéficiaires du programme.",NA,1,0,2,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15150,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Extreme climatic events are expected to further threaten water supply in addition to impacting key economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry and energy. Current policy and investment plans for water resource management need to be better informed to cope with the expected impacts of climate change in the future. This project addresses two challenges of the Central American and Caribbean countries: the need to enhance water security and the need to facilitate climate change adaptation actions through improved investment policies. In addition, it contributes to the ongoing regional decentralization process to strengthen municipal capacities in the face of climate change.The Water Centre for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean will lead this project in collaboration with the University of San Carlos in Guatemala and the Technological Institute of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The research team will define biophysical, socio-economic and institutional vulnerabilities to climate change linked to the water sector. It will identify key climate change stressors, and also map and assess the seasonal vulnerability of water resources at the regional level.  Finally, it will investigate how adaptation and investment policies can integrate local vulnerabilities to climate change by using four pilot municipalities located in the watersheds of the Samala and Yaque Norte rivers in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic respectively.The results will be synthesised in a set of recommendations for policy makers on how to incorporate climate change adaptation into investment policies addressing water security at the local level. Research results will also be shared through peer-reviewed publications and the establishment of a virtual learning community that will provide on-line training courses for 40 undergraduate and postgraduate students from Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. The Water Centre for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean will also develop an open-access database of future adaptation policies for the river basins of Central America and the Caribbean.This project is funded through the IDRC Research Initiative on Water Resources and Adaptation to Climate Change in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean with funds from the Government of Canada's fast-start climate change financing, 2011.",NA,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,1,0,2,0,"2012-10-31",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Until recently, however, little attention has been paid to sanitation by national governments and the international community. For example, Kenya and Uganda have been overhauling their water governance and delivery mechanisms with support from the World Bank since 2002. But Kenya only launched its Environmental Sanitation and Hygiene Policy in 2007, and has yet to develop regulatory guidelines and standards.In Kenya, only about 5% of the population have access to flushable toilets, while 13% have no form of sanitation at all (2002). Due to socioeconomic constraints, cultural factors and biological differences, women and schoolgirls are most affected by the lack of environmental services. This action-research project will attempt to address the gender, social, technical and environmental challenges related to sanitation infrastructure (toilets) in two small towns in Kenya (Naivasha) and Uganda (Masaka). Researchers will identify and test alternative, affordable options that are responsive to gender needs and concerns, and propose relevant practical and policy changes in order to increase access to improved water and sanitation services by the urban poor.",NA,2,2,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14031,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, the project will: support restructuring the Environmental Division (ED) in the Ministry of Transport, Environment and Women's Affairs (MTEWA) for better policy planning and coordination; and strengthen the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to better carry out its analytical, monitoring, and enforcement responsibilities; support ongoing efforts to integrate environmental considerations in the overall development planning process; and help the government take immediate remedial measures to reverse the trend of environmental degradation through pilot programs involving participatory approaches to environmental management.  The project will comprise three major components:  (1) Institutional Strengthening -restructuring ED within MTEWA to allow it to play a central role in environmental policy, planning and coordination nationally; restructuring and strengthening CEA by establishing and implementing a staff development program; enhancing the Industrial Licensing and Inspection Program; developing environmental codes of practice for small industries; improving   EIA capacity, and strengthening the environmental information system; providing office and technical facilities to accommodate both ED and CEA; and studying linkages between sector and economy-wide policies and the environment including an annual review of the environmental implications of the Public Investment Program (PIP), and further updating the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).  (2) Community Environmental Initiatives Facility (CEIF) -which will be established to finance well-planned environmental activities at the grass-roots level within the priority NEAP/PIP.  CEIF will provide a mechanism for pooling resources -to which other donors could also contribute- and serve as a vehicle for private sector and NGO participation and for decentralizing environmental activities.

The community health workers help reduce the incidence of malaria, HIV/AIDS and other preventable health problems through the provision of community health education and services to children and mothers. Five health clinics in Tanzania are being rehabilitated. To promote effectiveness and sustainability, AMREF is documenting best practices for training community health workers, identify the most effective methods for improving the integration of these health workers into the government's health systems, and document lessons learned for strengthening health systems with community health workers. AMREF Canada works with local NGO partners, government ministries (at the district level and national levels), community institutions and health experts in the field. AMREF Canada also promotes Canadian public engagement on maternal and child health through presentations, social networking activities, and media. / Le projet d'AMREF Canada vise à améliorer l'accès à l'information et aux services de santé de base, particulièrement en ce qui a trait à la santé des enfants et des mères, en formant 1 320 travailleurs de la santé communautaire dans les communautés marginalisées et vulnérables de la Tanzanie, du Kenya et de l'Ouganda, en plus de 800 praticiens de la santé traditionnelle en Afrique du Sud. Les travailleurs de la santé communautaire réduisent les incidences de paludisme, du VIH/SIDA et autres problèmes de santé que l'on peut prévenir par l'entremise d'éducation et de services de santé aux enfants et aux mères. Cinq cliniques de santé en Tanzanie sont remises en état. Afin de favoriser l'efficacité et la durabilité, AMREF documente les pratiques exemplaires pour la formation de travailleurs de la santé communautaire, identifie les méthodes les plus efficaces pour améliorer l'intégration de ces travailleurs de la santé dans les systèmes de santé du gouvernement, et documente les leçons retenues pour renforcer les systèmes de santé avec les travailleurs de la santé communautaire. AMREF Canada travaille avec les ONG partenaires locales, les ministères gouvernementaux (au niveau des districts et au niveau national), les institutions communautaires et les experts de la santé sur le terrain.

This includes issures regarding competitiveness of fish exports (quality, price) while ensuring the preservation of biodiversity through promoting the sustainable use of maritime resources. This will be done through increasing value-added to exports by providing policy advice to the government for creating favorable framework conditions for exports, strengthening the competitiveness of the supply side (e.g. in terms of price and quality, compliance with international sustainability standards) and facilitating entry into the global value chains.  The duration of the Project is 4.5 years with a budget of USD 4,935,000. SECO is requested to contribute USD 4,500,0000 (CHF 4'050'000) and the remainder is covered by the Project counterpart (MMAF) through direct funding and in-kind contribution. There is no funding gap.  The Project will be implemented in two phases; a 6-month inception phase focusing on a detailed work plan involving various stakeholders, followed by 48-months of implementation and development. At the strategic level, a Steering Committee with membership of SECO, UNIDO, and MMAF will monitor and provide operational guidance to the implementing team.

La línea de trabajo seguida se ha orientado al desarrollo de las capacidades para responder a las demandas de la población, después de más de 30 años refugiada, dando paso a la concepción de  Desarrollo en el Refugio  mientras no se resuelva el conflicto político actual.Este proyecto pretende consolidar y cerrar una etapa en las que se está tratando de promocionar desde 2005, proyectos de formación, equipamiento y asistencia técnica con programas definidos:i) Programa de crédito en las wilayas con las Oficinas de Desarrollo Local dependientes de la estructura del Ministerio de Cooperación, y con el programa de cooperativas de la Unión Nacional de Mujeres Saharauis (UNMS), a través de sus oficinas en las Casas de la Mujer de la UNMS. Proyectos iniciados con el apoyo del FOCAD 2005 y 2006.ii) Programa de empleo para la Juventud a través de un Centro de talleres y servicios en la wilaya de Smara. Proyecto iniciado con el apoyo del FOCAD 2007.Las oficinas de desarrollo local tienen como objetivo apoyar el desarrollo de capacidades e iniciativas locales en el plano económico, para lograr una mejora en las condiciones de vida de la población y promover iniciativas de desarrollo en el refugio adquiriendo capacidades profesionales de cara al futuro. Se está apoyando a las personas que trabajan en la Función Pública para mantener su trabajo en el sector público y apoyarles con iniciativas económicas que mejoren sus condiciones de vida. Con el programa de la UNMS, se promociona directamente a las mujeres, organizadas en cooperativas para desarrollar iniciativas económicas a nivel local.En cada wilaya la oficina de crédito y la oficina del programa de cooperativas de la UNMS se ha conformado con personal técnico especializado para atender las demandas de la población, y un comité consultivo conformado por representantes de cada wilaya de las instancias siguientes: Ministerio de Cooperación, UNMS, Función Pública, Gobernación de la wilaya. El equipo técnico se encarga de atender, estudiar y hacer seguimiento a las iniciativas que se promocionen en cada programa (actualmente hay una cartera de crédito en funcionamiento, ver anexos) y el comité consultivo se encargará de preservar la equidad, el acceso de las personas que realmente cumplan con las condiciones y requisitos necesarios, así como para motivar con nuevas iniciativas desde las dairas en cada wilaya. Se tendrá especial incidencia en la perspectiva de género (igualdad de oportunidades y acceso al proyecto) y en la sostenibilidad medioambiental por los efectos de estas iniciativas económicas, aunque son casi irrelevantes.

This component of the project, implemented by the PAHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), focuses on institutional capacity building within the Ministry of Public Health and Population and its departmental divisions. The key areas of intervention include training of qualified personnel, cold chain maintenance and vaccine management, as well as mobilization strategies for groups targeted by vaccination campaigns.
